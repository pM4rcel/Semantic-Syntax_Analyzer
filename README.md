# Formal Languages, Automata and Compilers Project

## 2nd year, 1st semester

Requires `lex` and `yacc` installed firstly.

Run on a linux terminal `./Assembler` to build the project.

The executable must receive a file on which to perform the analysis, and it 
will write in separate files the symbol table, functions table and 
details about them (return type, data type, parameters).

You have some samples on which to run the program.
